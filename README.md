## The singularity will be indistinguishable from magic

- 👋 Hi, I’m an artist/engineer/ops guy, passionate about systems monitoring, data viz and ops. Secular liminalism. C-PTSD, ADHD, he/him.
- 👀 Interested in stuff that helps grow transpersonal empathy on and around our planet. Gamifying activism, VR in prisons, immersive storytelling.
- 🌱 Learning web scraping with python, storytelling, oil painting and prompt engineering for science fiction.
- ✨ Uncomfortable after learning about how symbiotic relationships with hookworms can treat some autoimmune disorders. I can imagine the ads now: _"Are you violently allergic to legumes?  Do you suffer from asthma?  Come on down to Hooky's Latrine and Wellness Center, where the largest known infestation of Kentucky hookworm in the world will cure your auto-immune disorder...or your money back!"_

- 📫 I enjoy chats about stuff, monitoring/observability, techni-socialism, simulation theory, reality tunnels, alert correlation patterns.  Aliens.  

#### Projects

I'm looking for open source projects that support removing barriers to creative expression, production, curation, and ownership of art. ML models are disrupting the art economy, ushering in self-funded content devoid of corporate sponsorship and curation by the oligarchy.  As Bernie Sanders often says: _"[Creative expression]...is a human right and not a privledge."_  This is probably just a bunch of starry-eyed ramblings and [will end up being much much worse](https://web.archive.org/web/20220505080211/https://nicksaraev.com/dall-e-2-the-death-of-art/), but, I'm trying to remain a little optimistic. 🤷‍♂️
