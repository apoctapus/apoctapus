## Let me stay a while, my dogs are thirsty and it's making my gums itch.

- 👋 Hi, I’m an artist/engineer/ops guy, passionate about systems monitoring, data viz and ops. Secular liminalism. C-PTSD, ADHD, he/him.
- 👀 Interested in stuff that helps grow transpersonal empathy on and around our planet. Gamifying activism, VR in prisons, immersive storytelling.
- 🌱 Learning web scraping with python, storytelling, oil painting and prompt engineering for science fiction.
- ✨ Uncomfortable after learning about how symbiotic relationships with hookworms can treat some autoimmune disorders. 
     "Do you suffer from asthma?  Come down to Hooky's Latrine and Wellness Center, take off your shoes and cure your asthma!"

- 💞️ Enjoy chats about stuff, monitoring/observability, techni-socialism, simulation theory, alert correlation patterns.  Aliens.
     Also, open to any work that helps usher in the death of art, and the birth of artistic general intelligence. Viva la 99.9.
